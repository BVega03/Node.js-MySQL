# Node.js-MySQL
bamazon

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app can also be programmed to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


## Set Up
Save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in files-- app will need them for data input and storage.

  Clone repository. ```git clone``` https://github.com/BVega03/Node.js-MySQL.git

## Getting Started

Click link ```github link``` https://bvega03.github.io/Node.js-MySQL/

Run the application to display all of the items available for sale. This will include ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

The app will prompt users with two messages:

**1. "What is the ID of the product you would like to buy?"**

**2. "If you don't know the item, search all items?"**


What Each Search Should Do

*1. item_id*

- This will search the unique id for each product

*2. product_name*

- This will search the name of the product

*3. department_name*

- This will search the department name

*4. price*

- This will search the cost to the customer

*5. stock_quantity*

- This will search how much of the product is available in the stores

This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

- Example 1 - NIKE
  * Item ID - 1
  * Product Name - NIKE
  * Department Name - Footwear
  * Price - $100
  * Stock Quantity - 10
